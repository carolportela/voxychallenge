# voxychallenge
This test flow was chosen because I consider it to be the main flow of the page. A login page should allow for easy and intuitive user input.
To run the test it is necessary to have the Selenium IDE plugin installed on your chosen browser. You can download the Selenium IDE from https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/.
After that, simply open the plugin, click on the Open Project button (or press ctrl+O), choose the file in your downloads folder (Voxy Login.side) and and click the play button (or press ctrl+R). The test should start and the log is available within the plugin.
